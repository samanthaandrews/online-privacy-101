          This step is the most essential because it makes all the other steps easier. Sign up for a password manager.
          According to internet expert <a href="https://pjrvs.com/">Paul Jarvis</a>, here's what you should look for in
          a password manager:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            End-to-end encryption. This means the software that stores your passwords encrypts your data. Even if the
            password manager is hacked, your data is safe.
          </li>
          <li>Easy 2-factor authentication through the password manager.</li>
          <li>Alerts if any of your accounts have been hacked.</li>
          <li>
            Bonuses: Virtual Private Network (VPN), browser plugin that will auto-fill passwords, import/export
            passwords from your browser, auto-generate strong passwords.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There are a lot of options: <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>,
          <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>, <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/">Dashlane</a>,
          <a href="https://www.remembear.com/">RememBear</a>, and many, many more. <a href="https://myki.com/">Myki</a>,
          another option, saves your passwords offline (no cloud). I personally use Dashlane and love it. (I'm not an
          affiliate or partner!)
        </p>
        <p>
          The good news is most of the options I listed have a free tier with limited features. If you can afford the
          ~$30-50/year for 1Password, Dashlane, etc., I highly recommend forking over the cash.
        </p>

          <div>
            Once you've chosen a solution for your password storage, install it in all the places where you'll need to
            access these passwords. I use Dashlane's <strong>desktop app</strong>, <strong>iOS app</strong>, and
            <strong>browser plugin for Firefox</strong>.

          Transfer all your passwords to your shiny new password manager!
        </h3>
        <p>
          Where have you been storing your passwords? The browser? Apple keychain? Old-fashioned paper notebook?
          Wherever it may be, it's time to transfer all of that information to your password manager. There are 3 many
          ways to transfer your passwords:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Import/export.</strong> LastPass and Dashlane let you import passwords from a number of browsers.
            This is the easiest way by far to get started. If you’re using a Mac, you might also have your login info
            stored in Apple’s Keychain application; export your data using the guide
            <a
              href="https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/import-and-export-keychain-items-kyca35961/mac">here</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>As you browse.</strong> Most password managers with a browser plugin will prompt you to add login
            information as you go about your business normally.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Manually.</strong> Tedious, but effective.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Here are guides for where to find your passwords in
          <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95606?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en-GB">Chrome</a>,

            Once you've transferred your data to your password manager, it's time to remove that data from wherever it
            was previously stored.
            <strong>This means you need to delete your passwords from your browser and turn off the browser preference
              to
              store this information. </strong>It's up to your password manager to take care of this from now on!

          Once you've set up your password manager, it's time to start changing your passwords. This can be intimidating
          and time-consuming, but don't let it keep you from taking action!
          <strong>I recommend changing your top 5 most used accounts immediately, and then gradually changing the rest
            whenever you log onto those sites.</strong>
          Here are the accounts I recommend changing right now:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Email accounts (Google, Outlook, iCloud, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.)</li>
          <li>Document storage (Dropbox, etc.)</li>
          <li>Bank & credit card accounts</li>
          <li>Money transfer apps (PayPal, Venmo, CashApp)</li>
          <li>Amazon</li>
          <li>Social media accounts (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, TikTok, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout">
            <div style="font-size:1.5em"><span class="icon" role="image" aria-label="star-icon">✰</span></div>
            <div>
              Before you start changing your passwords, make sure you are doing so over a secure network connection. How do
              you know if your network is secure? Usually your home internet connection is secure if it requires a WPA2
              password, but a public internet connection is not. Jump down to the section on using a
              <a href="#section-5">Virtual Private Network</a> to learn more.
            </div>
          </div>
        <p>
          How can you make sure your newly created passwords are unique and secure? Oftentimes, your password manager
          comes with this feature built-in. With Dashlane, I'm prompted to "Generate a strong password" whenever I
          create a new password or change an existing one. In the past I've used this
          <a href="https://strongpasswordgenerator.com/">free strong password generator</a>.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <div style="font-size:1.5em"><span class="icon" role="image" aria-label="star-icon">✰</span></div>
          <p>
            However you generate your passwords, make sure they're different for each and every account.

          Two-factor authentication is a process that gives web services secondary access to the account owner (you) in
          order to verify a login attempt.
        </p>
        <p>
          While you're in the process of changing your passwords, take a couple extra minutes to set up two-factor
          authentication for your most critical accounts. Here's a
          <a href="https://twofactorauth.org">helpful site to search</a> if you're wondering whether or not two-factor
          authentication is available for your account and how to set it up.
        </p>
        <h3>Download a mobile authenticator app</h3>
        <p>
          While most apps support two-factor authentication via text message, the more secure option is to use an
          authenticator app. In addition, authenticator apps offer flexibility when you are traveling to a place without
          cellular service. Popular options include Authy, Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or HDE OTP
          (iOS only).
        </p>
        <h3>Save secret keys in your password manager</h3>
        <p>
          While enabling two-factor authentication, you will likely be prompted with several "secret keys" to copy and
          save. These codes can be used to access your account as a last-resort if you are unable to access your mobile
          device. I save my secret keys in Dashlane in the "Notes" section of the account they're associated with.

          My hard & fast recommendation is to delete your Facebook account entirely. However, if you need to keep your
          account, you can lock down your data in your settings panel. Facebook has made it easier to control your
          privacy settings in recent years, but there are still multiple places to edit this information. I recommend
          navigating to settings, and editing your privacy controls in every panel on the left-hand side of the screen.

          Truthfully, this is where my knowledge about security and online privacy starts to diminish. I've never used a
          VPN until recently, and it's only because Dashlane provides one with my paid account. Here's
          <a href="https://support.dashlane.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001158385">Dashlane's</a> take on why and when you
          might want to use a VPN:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <strong>What is a VPN?</strong>
          As its name suggests, a Virtual Private Network is about privacy. It creates a network, or a closed system of
          communication between you and the VPN provider. And that network is virtual because, unlike a "real" network,
          there is no preexisting, dedicated infrastructure.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <strong>Why should I use a VPN?</strong>
          In many cases, your access to the internet, be it at home or at work, is safe and secure. But when you're on
          the move and use free or unfamiliar networks such as in airports, hotels or cafes, you're opening yourself up
          to your data being observed and potentially stolen. This is especially true if you visit web addresses using
          “http”, not “https”, or access an email account using unsafe protocols. A VPN allows you to go online through
          a secure connection even when you're on an insecure network. When you're on the internet, you're anything but
          anonymous. Your IP address is public information, and locates you geographically. Using a VPN means that your
          internet traffic is routed through the VPN provider. So instead of your own IP address, your traffic now
          reaches the internet from the location of the VPN's server. Additionally, your service provider cannot see
          what websites you're visiting, since the traffic through the VPN is encrypted.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Like password managers, there are many options when it comes to VPN providers including

          <a href="https://privatevpn.com/">PrivateVPN</a>, <a href="https://protonvpn.com/">ProtonVPN</a>, and many
          more. It's generally recommended that you don't use a free VPN service, as they may be monetizing your
          connection in other ways.

          DuckDuckGo, it's as if you've never been there before.

          Just like it's important to change your passwords regularly, you can add an extra layer of security (and avoid
          phishing attempts) by changing up your email accounts. In addition, you can choose to use a fake name and
          identifying information when registering for email accounts. This is legal and you should do it to avoid
          having your data mined across services.

          If you really want to avoid any info from a website, you can use a service like

          <a href="https://mailsac.com/">Mailsac</a> to create fake email addresses. These temporary inbox services will
          only hold emails for a small period of time (anywhere between 10 minutes to a week). — Natt Garun,

          Software updates are important because they often include critical patches to security holes. The next time

            Delete online accounts you no longer use. This is more difficult than it seems, as many providers do not
