# Online Privacy 101
A practical, open-source guide to protect yourself online

## Motivation
I started writing this guide after my parents asked me to help them clean up their digital footprint and make their online presence more secure.

My goal is to give everyone who reads this guide the tools and confidence to start taking control of their digital privacy.
